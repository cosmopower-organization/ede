The `v2` emulators are the emulators used in [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Constraints on Extended Cosmological Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14454) (2025).

These emulators were then used in [Impact of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 for Early Dark Energy and the Hubble tension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08051) by Poulin et al (2025).

They are the highest accuracy class-based emulators available on this organization and match the camb-based [Jense et al. (2024) Emulators](https://github.com/cosmopower-organization/jense_2024_emulators) in LCDM well under 0.1-$\sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the typical 68\%CL on parameter constraints using ACT DR6 data. 

The emulators can be used in LCDM, mnu-LCDM, w-CDM and Neff-LCDM and combinations of these. 

They emulate distances, TT, TE, EE, BB and P(k).
